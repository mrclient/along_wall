## Brief description
The package contains a simple node written in two different languages which causes a mobile robot to move along a wall. To work it needs to know a desired distance to the wall, gain of a P-controller used and a desired linear velocity of the robot.

The project is quite simple due to it was developed as an easy demonstration of some ROS concepts (such as publisher-subscriber mechanism) and some other things. Nevertheless, if you need you can find more information about the node internals at [wiki](https://github.com/mrclient/along_wall/wiki).

A target ROS distro is/was Indigo (as far as I remember).
